# Monitoring, Logging, and API Tracing on GKE Cluster

This repository provides the steps to integrate various third-party tools for monitoring, logging, and API tracing in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.

## Monitoring

### 1. Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that provides metrics and alerting capabilities. It can be used in conjunction with Grafana for visualization.

#### Integration Steps:
1. Install Prometheus on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
2. **Configure Prometheus** to scrape metrics from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
3. **Install Grafana** on your GKE cluster and configure it to connect to Prometheus.

### 2. New Relic
New Relic is a comprehensive monitoring platform that provides detailed insights into application performance, infrastructure, and user experience.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Create a New Relic account** and obtain an API key.
2. **Install the New Relic agent** on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
3. **Configure the agent** to report metrics to New Relic.

### 3. Datadog
Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform that provides real-time visibility into application performance, infrastructure, and user experience.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Create a Datadog account** and obtain an API key.
2. **Install the Datadog agent** on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
3. **Configure the agent** to report metrics to Datadog.

## Logging

### 1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
The ELK Stack is a popular open-source logging and analytics platform that provides centralized log management, search, and visualization capabilities.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Install Elasticsearch** on your GKE cluster using a StatefulSet.
2. **Install Logstash** on your GKE cluster using a Deployment YAML file.
3. **Configure Logstash** to collect logs from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
4. **Install Kibana** on your GKE cluster and configure it to connect to Elasticsearch.

### 2. Papertrail
Papertrail is a cloud-based logging platform that provides real-time log aggregation, search, and alerting capabilities.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Create a Papertrail account** and obtain an API key.
2. **Install the Papertrail agent** on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
3. **Configure the agent** to forward logs to Papertrail.

### 3. Loggly
Loggly is a cloud-based logging platform that provides real-time log aggregation, search, and alerting capabilities.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Create a Loggly account** and obtain an API key.
2. **Install the Loggly agent** on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
3. **Configure the agent** to forward logs to Loggly.

## API Tracing

### 1. Jaeger
Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system that provides detailed insights into API requests and responses. It integrates well with Kubernetes and GKE.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Install Jaeger** on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
2. **Configure Jaeger** to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
3. **Instrument your application code** to send traces to Jaeger.

### 2. Zipkin
Zipkin is an open-source distributed tracing system that provides detailed insights into API requests and responses. It integrates well with Kubernetes and GKE.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Install Zipkin** on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
2. **Configure Zipkin** to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
3. **Instrument your application code** to send traces to Zipkin.

### 3. New Relic
In addition to monitoring, New Relic also provides API tracing capabilities that provide detailed insights into API requests and responses.

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Configure New Relic** to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
2. **Instrument your application code** to send traces to New Relic.

## Conclusion
This repository contains the necessary steps to integrate third-party tools for effective monitoring, logging, and API tracing in your GKE cluster. By following these instructions, you can gain deep insights into your cluster's performance, logs, and API activity.
