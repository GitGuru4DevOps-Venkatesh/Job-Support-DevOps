Monitoring, Logging, and API Tracing on GKE Cluster using Third-Party Tools
Monitoring
1. Prometheus
A popular open-source monitoring system that provides metrics and alerting capabilities.
Can be used in conjunction with Grafana for visualization.
Integration Steps:

Install Prometheus on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
Install Grafana on your GKE cluster and configure it to connect to Prometheus.
2. New Relic
A comprehensive monitoring platform that provides detailed insights into application performance, infrastructure, and user experience.
Offers a free tier with limited features.
Integration Steps:

Create a New Relic account and obtain an API key.
Install the New Relic agent on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
Configure the agent to report metrics to New Relic.
3. Datadog
A monitoring and analytics platform that provides real-time visibility into application performance, infrastructure, and user experience.
Offers a free tier with limited features.
Integration Steps:

Create a Datadog account and obtain an API key.
Install the Datadog agent on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
Configure the agent to report metrics to Datadog.
Logging
1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
A popular open-source logging and analytics platform that provides centralized log management, search, and visualization capabilities.
Integration Steps:

Install Elasticsearch on your GKE cluster using a StatefulSet.
Install Logstash on your GKE cluster using a Deployment YAML file.
Configure Logstash to collect logs from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
Install Kibana on your GKE cluster and configure it to connect to Elasticsearch.
2. Papertrail
A cloud-based logging platform that provides real-time log aggregation, search, and alerting capabilities.
Offers a free tier with limited features.
Integration Steps:

Create a Papertrail account and obtain an API key.
Install the Papertrail agent on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
Configure the agent to forward logs to Papertrail.
3. Loggly
A cloud-based logging platform that provides real-time log aggregation, search, and alerting capabilities.
Offers a free tier with limited features.
Integration Steps:

Create a Loggly account and obtain an API key.
Install the Loggly agent on your GKE cluster nodes using a DaemonSet.
Configure the agent to forward logs to Loggly.
API Tracing
1. Jaeger
An open-source distributed tracing system that provides detailed insights into API requests and responses.
Integrates well with Kubernetes and GKE.
Integration Steps:

Install Jaeger on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
Configure Jaeger to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
Instrument your application code to send traces to Jaeger.
2. Zipkin
An open-source distributed tracing system that provides detailed insights into API requests and responses.
Integrates well with Kubernetes and GKE.
Integration Steps:

Install Zipkin on your GKE cluster using a Helm chart or a Deployment YAML file.
Configure Zipkin to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
Instrument your application code to send traces to Zipkin.
3. New Relic
In addition to monitoring, New Relic also provides API tracing capabilities that provide detailed insights into API requests and responses.
Integration Steps:

Configure New Relic to collect traces from your GKE cluster nodes and pods.
Instrument your application code to send traces to New Relic.
